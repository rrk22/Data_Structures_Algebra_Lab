<H2>CS 314 Assignment 7: Trees and Symbolic Algebra</H2>

<H3>Due: October 30, 2014.</H3>

<B>Files:</B> <tt>Cons.java</tt> &nbsp; <tt>formulas.lsp</tt>

<P>
The following functions that operate on trees should be recursive.
Some useful functions that you may need are provided in the file
<tt>Cons.java</tt>, and you will need some of your functions from the
last assignment.  This assignment may be done in Java or in Lisp.

<OL>

<P><LI> You have been assigned to explore a cave to see whether it
contains a treasure.  The treasure is too heavy for you to carry out;
you must return instructions to get to the treasure.
Each room of the cave is either a junction, with two connecting passages
called <TT>first</TT> and <TT>rest</TT>, or it is a dead end that may or
may not be a treasure.

<OL>
<LI> Write a function <TT>Cons findpath(Object item, Object cave)</TT> that
will find a path
to a part of <TT> cave</TT> that matches <TT> item</TT>; we will asssume
that <TT> .equals()</TT> can be used to test.  <TT> findpath</TT> returns
<TT> null</TT> if <TT> item</TT> does not occur in <TT> cave</TT>; otherwise,
it returns a list of <TT> "first"</TT> and <TT> "rest"</TT> that describes the
path to the item, ending with <TT> "done"</TT>.
<TT> findpath</TT> is easily written as a recursive function.
Examples:
<PRE>
(findpath 'a 'b)     = null
(findpath 'a 'a)     = ("done")
(findpath 'a '(a))   = ("first" "done")
(findpath 'gold '(rocks gold (monster))) = ("rest" "first" "done")
</PRE>

<P><LI> Write an interpreter <TT>Object follow(Cons path, Object cave)</TT>
that will follow a path as returned by <TT>findpath</TT> and retrieve the
contents of <TT>cave</TT> at the location specified by <TT>path</TT>.
An interpreter reads a list of instructions and performs the action
specified by each instruction.
<PRE>
(follow '("rest" "first" "done") '(rocks gold (monster)))  =  gold
</PRE>

<P><LI> Write a function
<TT>Object corresp(Object item, Object tree1, Object tree2)</TT>
that finds the item, corresponding to <TT>item</TT> in <TT>tree1</TT>,
in <TT>tree2</TT>.  Example:
<PRE>
(corresp 'light '((my eyes) (have seen (the light)))
                '((my ears) (have heard (the music))))
  ==> music
</PRE>
</OL>
<LI> Write a recursive function <tt>Cons solve(Cons e, String v)</tt> that
attempts to solve the equation <tt>e</tt> for variable <tt>v</tt>.
We assume that any variable occurs at most once in <tt>e</tt>, and that the
equation initially has a left-hand side that is a single variable.
The basic idea of <tt>solve</tt> is to test for equations that are
already solved or unsolvable (base cases); otherwise, <tt>solve</tt>
will search for a solution by applying laws of algebra to transform the
equation into different forms.  <tt>solve</tt> is a kind of tree
recursion -- not recursion on <tt>first</tt> and <tt>rest</tt>, but
recursion on the applicable transformations of the input formula into new
formulas.  The functions <tt>op</tt>, <tt>lhs</tt> and <tt>rhs</tt>
are provided.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> If the left-hand side (<tt>lhs</tt>) of <tt>e</tt> is <tt>v</tt>,
return <tt>e</tt>.
<PRE>
   (solve '(= f (* m a)) 'f)  =>  (= f (* m a))
</PRE>

<LI> If the right-hand side (<tt>rhs</tt>) of <tt>e</tt> is <tt>v</tt>, return
a new version <tt>e</tt> with its <tt>lhs</tt> and <tt>rhs</tt> reversed.
<PRE>
   (solve '(= (* m a) f) 'f)  =>  (= f (* m a))
</PRE>

<LI> If the <tt>rhs</tt> is not <tt>v</tt> and not a Cons, return <tt>null</tt>.

<P><LI> If the <tt>rhs</tt> of <tt>e</tt> is a Cons (i.e. an operation),
try to solve the equation by applying algebraic
laws, which will make a new equation by moving things to the left side.
Then try to solve <i>that</i> equation.  For binary operators, there will
be two possibilities, both of which must be tried.  For example, given the
original equation <I>x = y - z</I>, we could (a) add <I>z</I> to both sides
to give <I>x + z = y</I>, or (b) subtract y from both sides to give
<I>x - y = - z</I> and then negate both sides to give <I>y - x = z</I>
(these two operations can be combined as a single transformation).
<PRE>
   (solve '(= x (- y z)) 'y)
      (solve '(= (- y x) z) 'y)   ; first try:  null
      (solve '(= (+ x z) y) 'y)   ; second try: succeeds
    =>  (= y (+ x z))
</PRE>
</OL>

You should handle the operators <tt>+ - * / sqrt exp log</tt> and
<tt>(expt </tt><i>x  </i><tt>2)</tt>.  <tt>exp</tt> (e to the given
power) and <tt>log</tt> (logarithm to the base e)
are inverses, and <tt>(expt x 2)</tt> and <tt>sqrt</tt> are inverses
(we will assume that <tt>expt</tt> is only used with the power 2).
The operator <tt>-</tt> can be either unary (having only one argument,
i.e. minus) or binary (having two arguments, i.e. difference),
which must be treated differently.  We will assume that all other operators
will have a fixed number of arguments (either one or two).
<P>
Demonstrate that you can solve the following equations for any of their
variables.  These equations are defined in the file.
<PRE>
   (= s (* 0.5 (* a (expt t 2))))
   (= s (+ s0 (* v t)))
   (= a (/ f m))
   (= v (* a t))
   (= f (/ (* m v) t))
   (= f (/ (* m (expt v 2)) r))
   (= h (- h0 (* 4.94 (expt t 2))))
   (= c (sqrt (+ (expt a 2) (expt b 2))))
   (= v (* v0 (- 1 (exp (/ (- t) (* r c))))))
</PRE>

<P>
<LI> Modify your function <tt>eval</tt> from the previous assignment
so that it returns <tt>Double</tt> and assumes that values supplied in
the <tt>bindings</tt> list are also <tt>Double</tt>.  Extend it to
also handle the functions <tt>sqrt</tt>, <tt>exp</tt> and <tt>log</tt>;
you can use library functions such as <tt>Math.pow</tt> etc.

<P>
<LI> Students in beginning physics courses
often solve homework problems by searching through the
book for an equation that relates the desired variable
and the variables whose values are given.
<P>
Define a function
<tt>Double solveit(Cons equations, String var, Cons values)</tt> where
<tt>equations</tt> is a list of equations, <tt>var</tt> is a variable
whose value is desired, and <tt>values</tt> is an association list of variables
with known values.  Search the list <tt>equations</tt> to find an
equation that relates exactly these variables.  Solve the equation for
the desired variable and evaluate the solved equation to find its value.
<PRE>
   (solveit formulas 'm '((f 10.0) (a 2.0)))  =>  5.0
</PRE>
Use the equations in <tt>formulas</tt> to solve the following problems:
<OL>

4 seconds.  What is the height of the tower in meters?
